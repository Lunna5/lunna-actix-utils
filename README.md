# lunna_actix_utils

**Utilities for Actix Web projects by [lunna.dev](https://lunna.dev)**

This crate provides small, reusable components used across my personal projects built with [Actix Web](https://actix.rs). It includes custom extractors and helpers to reduce boilerplate and keep things clean.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a personal-use crate. You're welcome to explore or use it, but it's tailored to my own workflows and may change frequently.

## Features

- [`ValidatedJson`] extractor: automatically validates incoming JSON payloads using [`validator`](https://docs.rs/validator).
- More utilities coming as needed.
